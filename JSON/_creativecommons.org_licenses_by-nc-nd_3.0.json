Photoinduced treatment was carried out using two beams of splitted Er: glass laser operating at 1.54 \u03bcm. The light of the laser was incident at different angles and the angles between the beams also were varied. Also, the studies of nanocomposite effective structures have shown enhancement of effective nanocrystalline sizes during the laser treatment. Nanocrystallites of CuInS<jats:sub>2<\/jats:sub> and CuZnSnS<jats:sub>4<\/jats:sub> (CZTS) were used as chalcogenide materials.
