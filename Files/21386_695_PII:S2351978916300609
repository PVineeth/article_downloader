               Abstract
               
                  Slow tool servo remains a preferred method for ultraprecision manufacture of freeform optics with millimeter-scale departures from an axisymmetric surface. A methodology has been developed for pre-process mapping of, and compensation for, predictable error sources such as tool waviness and machine misalignment, reducing necessity for typical post-process workpiece error correction procedures. This methodology is implemented for manufacture of a chalcogenide glass freeform lens pair for a variable-focus thermal imaging application. Process development, part metrology, and system functional testing are presented.

A methodology has been developed for  pre-process mapping of, and compensation for, predictable error sources such as tool waviness and  machine misalignment, reducing necessity for typical post-process workpiece error correction  procedures.  This methodology is implemented for manufacture of a chalcogenide glass freeform lens  pair for a variable-focus thermal imaging application.  Process development, part metrology, and  system functional testing are presented.    Keywords: slow tool servo, Alvarez lens, chalcogenide, diamond turning  1 Introduction  Optical components have traditionally been based upon combinations of planar and spherical  surfaces, primarily due to the ease of manufacture and testing.  Advances in capability of design and  simulation software have facilitated a revolution in optical system design (Thompson &amp; Rolland,  2012) through the use of freeform optical surfaces of arbitrary form.  When leveraged in both imaging  and non-imaging system design, these often non-axisymmetric surfaces provide distinct advantages  over traditional designs.  Several traditional surfaces can be combined into a single composite,  allowing reduction in component count, system mass, complexity, and eliminating many assembly- based sources of misalignment.  Freeform surfaces can be used for aberration correction and also to  enable novel function, such as in the case of the variable-focus Alvarez lens (Alvarez, 1967).   Enabling the manufacture of freeform optics allows further design freedom, such as inclusion of  integrated alignment, mounting, and fiducial features on an optic, transferring the accuracy of an  ultraprecision machine tool directly to assembly tolerances.   Procedia Manufacturing Volume 5, 2016, Pages 669â€“683 44th Proceedings of the North American Manufacturing Research Institution of SME http://www.sme.org/namrc Selection and peer-review under responsibility of the Scientiï¬�c Programme Committee of NAMRI/SME cÂ© The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V. 669    While there are many challenges associated with the manufacture and metrology of freeform  surfaces, contemporary ultraprecision machine tools enable direct machining of such optics with form  accuracies on order of Â±200 nm and surface finishes on order of 2 nm.  This is well suited for infrared  (IR) applications where finish and form tolerances are less stringent.  Many examples in the literature  demonstrate that under appropriate cutting conditions, brittle optical materials can be machined in a  ductile-dominated manner, leaving behind a fracture-free surface of optical quality.  IR materials such  as silicon and germanium can be processed by ultraprecision diamond turning (Ogura &amp; Okizaki,  2000) (Nakasuji, et al., 1990), milling (Smilie, et al., 2011) (Rusnaldy &amp; Kim, 2007), and grinding  (Bifano, et al., 1991).  For materials which are not as readily machined in a ductile-dominated manner,  similar surface finishes and form accuracies (Wolfs, et al., 2015) (Fess, et al., 2015) are achievable  using sub-aperture polishing of ground blanks.  When working to sub-micrometer tolerances, workpiece errors can arise from many sources, such  as tool shape error, tool deflection, machine tool axis misalignment, thermal effects, and  environmental vibration.  In many cases, producing an optic to specification requires machining, on- machine part measurement, generation of a compensated toolpath using on-machine workpiece error  measurement and correction software, then re-machining.  However, as described in (Owen &amp; Davies,  2015), the use of appropriate setup artifacts can enable pre-process mapping of predictable error  sources and generation of compensated toolpaths, obviating workpiece measurement and error  correction procedures which are time-consuming and must be done on a per workpiece basis.  In this paper, a methodology for tool selection and toolpath generation is presented for the slow  tool servo machining technique.  The pre-process mapping of tool and machine error sources and  subsequent manufacturing, functional testing, and metrology of a chalcogenide glass freeform  variable-focus lens pair based upon the Alvarez design is described.  Once predictable errors from the  machine and tool are mapped, the same tool can be used to manufacture other optics without  additional measurements.  2 Process Development  Ultraprecision machine tools are commonly developed from a fundamental building block, the  diamond turning lathe, which having sufficient accuracy and stiffness to do so, has been used for  several decades in the production of optical quality, rotationally symmetric surfaces.  Addition of a  position-controlled rotary axis, often via a configuration in which the main spindle can be switched  between speed-controlled and position-controlled modes, to a two-axis diamond turning lathe (Bryan,  2003) allows coordinated-axis slow tool servo (STS) machining of freeform optics with mild surface  departures.  STS operations typically occur at rotational rates from 100 to 2000 rpm, limited by the  machine toolâ€™s axis dynamics, controller bandwidth, and the required tool stroke.  While the tool is  mounted directly to the machine axes in the STS configuration, the tool can also be mounted to an  auxiliary-driven piezoelectric or voice coil actuator of much lower mass and inertia in a fast tool servo  (FTS) configuration, allowing tool motion at frequencies up to 1 kHz at the expense of stroke,  typically limited to several micrometers at such frequencies.  Contemporary ultraprecision machining  centers are often available with five (three linear- and two rotary-controlled) or more axes and high  speed (up to 60,000 rpm) secondary spindles which, with appropriate tooling, allow multi-axis  diamond milling and grinding of nearly arbitrary surfaces.  While the geometrical capabilities of  diamond milling are unmatched by turning-based processes and the production speed of FTS is  advantageous under certain circumstances, due to setup simplicity and modest additional equipment  requirements, the STS process often remains the preferred method of machining freeform surfaces  with millimeter-scale departures from an axisymmetric surface.  For an STS operation as described in this paper, the linear axes of a diamond turning lathe and the  rotary-controlled main spindle form an X-Z-C axis system, as illustrated in Figure 1.  Such an  Machining and Metrology of a Chalcogenide Glass Freeform Lens Pair Troutman et al. 670    arrangement suggests expression of part form in right cylindrical coordinates.  In this configuration,  the round-nosed tool is oriented such that the entire cutting edge lies in the X-Z plane, and such that  for any point on the part, cutting action occurs on the rounded portion of the tool nose.  Typical  ultraprecision machining operations are performed using single crystal diamond (SCD) tools with a  nose radius on the order of several millimeters.    Conventional macroscale components are easily-represented in modern CAD/CAM packages by  primitive solids and spline-based surfaces. However, optical surfaces are generally defined by an  equation or prescription, and cannot be represented in a like manner without introducing unacceptable  errors due to approximation inherent to fitting algorithms used in such software.  These software  packages, which also assume perfect tool shape and machine axis orthogonality, are therefore  inappropriate for toolpath generation for ultraprecision operations which often specify form tolerances  of Â±200 nm or tighter.  At these tolerance levels, successful optical manufacture often requires  compensation for tool shape deviations and machine axis alignment.  Therefore, an analytical  formulation for toolpath generation is necessary.  While use of any coding environment is feasible, the  work presented in this paper was performed using MATLABÂ“.      Figure 1: Slow tool servo machine configuration and part coordinate origin.  2.1 Tool Selection Criteria  For an optical surface described in the right cylindrical coordinates system shown in Figure 1, the  position of any point on the surface in those coordinates can be expressed according to Eq. 1.  For  surface prescriptions not expressed in these coordinates, an appropriate parameterization may be  required.   Slope and curvature analysis must be applied to select an appropriate tool geometry which  will prevent collisions between the tool and workpiece.  The nose radius of the tool, Rct, must be less  than the minimum radius of curvature in any individual Ï�â€“z plane on the part, as stated in Eq.  2.   Similarly, as stated in Eq. 3, the tool clearance angle, Î²t, must be greater than the maximum part slope  in any individual Ï•-z plane.  While large negative rake angles are preferred for some brittle materials,  many metals and glasses can be satisfactorily machined using zero rake tools.  à¢™áˆ¬Ô¦ àµŒ Ûƒß©Ç¡ ß¶Ç¡ Ý–áˆºß©Ç¡ ß¶áˆ»Û„ àµŒ ß©à£‹à·� àµ… ß¶à£˜à·¡ àµ… Ý–áˆºß©Ç¡ ß¶áˆ»à¢ à·œ (1)  Machining and Metrology of a Chalcogenide Glass Freeform Lens Pair Troutman et al. 671    Ü´à¯–à¯§ àµ‘ Â�Â‹Â�á‰Œá‰®á‰†Í³ àµ… àµ¬ ß²Ý–áˆºß©Ç¡ ß¶áˆ» ß²ß© àµ° à¬¶ á‰‡ à¬· à¬¶àµ— ß²à¬¶Ý–áˆºß©Ç¡ ß¶áˆ» ß²ß©à¬¶àµ™ á‰®á‰� (2)  ßšà¯§ àµ’ àµ¬à¸¬Â–ÂƒÂ�à¬¿à¬µ àµ¬ ß²Ý–áˆºß©Ç¡ ß¶áˆ» ß©ß²ß¶ àµ°à¸¬àµ° (3)  2.2 Error Mapping and Toolpath Generation  For an ideal, perfectly-shaped tool, cutting action occurs at a location along the tool nose where the  local tool and part slope are matched, as shown in Figure 2.  However, in practice, the tool is not  ideally-shaped, and has edge waviness, which can be described as a radius variation, dRct, which varies  with tool sweep angle, Î¸.  For typical diamond tools, these shape errors, which will produce slope- dependent errors on a machined part, can have magnitudes from 50 nm to several micrometers  depending on specified level of waviness control.      Figure 2: Tool waviness and cutting zone.  Initial tool setup using an on-machine microscope and known offsets from the spindle centerline to  the camera focus position are suitable for defining tool height and tip position with respect to the  spindle centerline to Â±10 Î¼m or better.  If the cutting edge is above the spindle centerline, a cone- shaped center defect will be present on a machined part, while a tool which is too low will result in a  cylindrical defect. Face-machining of an artifact, measurement of the center defect, and subsequent  tool height adjustment are sufficient to refine tool height within Â±1 Î¼m of the spindle centerline.   Similarly, by plunging the tool into the artifact and measuring the diameter of the resulting toric  recess, tool position along the X-direction can also be set to Â±1 Î¼m or better.  Residual tool offset  errors, Î´x and Î´z, are shown in Figure 1 and are defined as the difference between true and indicated  tool position relative to the spindle centerline.  These will be apparent on the final optic as slope  dependent error convolved with tool edge waviness effects.  Though correctable with offset  adjustments at the controller, the resulting slope-dependent error, measured along the z-coordinate of  the part, due to tool offset error is described by Eq. 4a-b for the usual case of Rct Ø¨ Î´x.  Similarly,  deviations from C-X perpendicularity, X-Z perpendicularity, or C-Z parallelism will combine to form  an effective X-Z angular misalignment, Î´xz,, producting a cone-shaped error on the optic.  The use of spherical artifacts for pre-process mapping of tool and machine errors for milling  operations is described in (Owen &amp; Davies, 2015).  Due to process geometry, milling and turning  processes typically only make use of a single side of the diamond tool (all points on the part  correspond to tool sweep of identical sign), but STS operations quite often use a portion of both sides  of the tool. While it is technically feasible to map both sides of a diamond tool using two diamond- Machining and Metrology of a Chalcogenide Glass Freeform Lens Pair Troutman et al. 672    turned artifacts, precision air bearing spindles often exhibit different error motions in position control  mode than during free rotation, thus, for the STS process, it is desirable to map the axis alignment  effects and tool errors using an artifact also machined by STS. Among the viable artifact types which  are easily measured, for example by Fizeau interferometry, are tilted flats and decentered spheres.

(b) Radial  slices and (c) circular slices of error map from Fig 2, (d) radial slice at Ï†=0Â° indicating machine axis  misalignment, (e) circular slice at Ï�=3 mm, showing contributions from tool offset error and tool waviness.  For applications where nearly equal portions of both sides of the tool nose are used, a tilted flat of  sufficient angle to fully sample the utilized tool sweep is appropriate.  The clearance angle of the tool,  usually from 5Â° to 10Â°, must be greater than the tilted flat angle to prevent tool-workpiece collisions,  placing a practical limitation on the maximum tool sweep that can be mapped using this type of  artifact.  However, when feasible, tilted flat artifacts are preferred, because machine axis and tool  errors are easily separated and can be independently discerned from a single measurement of the  Machining and Metrology of a Chalcogenide Glass Freeform Lens Pair Troutman et al. 673    artifact using a reference flat.  A small flat along one side is sufficient for aligning the measurement  into the artifact coordinate system. Radial slices of the artifact reveal axis misalignment errors, while  circular slices at a constant radius reveal slope dependent error tool errors.  Figure 3(a) presents a  simulated error map for a tilted flat of the form z(Ï�,Ï•) = Ï�cosÏ• with error sources as described in Table  1. Many radial and circular slices of this measurement are shown in Figure 3(b-c), while selected slices  are shown in Figure 3(d-e). Separation of tool and machine error sources is evident, as is the  contribution of tool offset error and waviness to total slope dependent error.

(b) Radial slices and (c) circular slices of composite error map, (d) radial slices of flat portion of artifact  indicating machine axis misalignment, (e) residual slope dependent errors after removing trends due to machine  sources, showing contributions of tool waviness and offset error.  For applications where a large portion of one side of the tool is used, a decentered sphere can be  used to map machine axis and tool errors with less stringent constraint on tool clearance angle.   Beginning with a cylindrical workpiece concentric to the rotary axis, the STS process is used to cut a  Machining and Metrology of a Chalcogenide Glass Freeform Lens Pair Troutman et al. 674    concave spherical recess which has a center point at some (Ï�0, Ï•0) location, offset from the axis  centerline.  The remainder of the artifact face is also machined flat in STS mode. Although often the  only feasible artifact, discernment of error sources is less straightforward than for a tilted flat.  Two  measurements are necessary to fully measure the artifact and separate tool and machine error sources.   The flat portion of the artifact face is measured using a reference flat, while a reference sphere is  necessary to measure the concave recess.  Further, at least two alignment features are necessary to  orient the two measurements with respect to one another and with the artifact coordinate system. Once  properly registered, machine axis misalignment can be determined from the measurement of the flat  portion of the artifact, which can be removed from that of the spherical portion, isolating slope  dependent tool errors.  Figure 4(a) presents a simulated composite error map for the decentered  concave sphere described in Table 2.  Many radial and circular slices of the composite measurement  are shown in Figure 4(b-c), while radial slices of only the flat portion are shown in Fig 5c.  After  determining machine axis errors and removing this trend from the measurement of the spherical  portion, slope dependent errors are isolated in Figure 4(d-e), showing contributions from both tool  offset error and tool waviness effects.    Once an artifact has been machined using an uncompensated toolpath and measured, tool offset  errors are identified and necessary controller offset corrections are applied.  If the artifact is of the  same material as the intended optic and is machined using identical depth of cut and stepover per  revolution, tool deflection will also result in a slope-dependent error which is convolved with tool  waviness. Remaining slope-dependent errors can typically be well-represented as a function of part  slope or tool sweep angle using a high-order polynomial, linear or cubic spline, or any other  representation which yields an acceptable fit to the measured artifact.  The artifact is then re-machined  using an appropriately compensated toolpath and re-measured.  Subsequent optics machined using  identical waviness and alignment compensations are then expected to display similar error magnitudes  as the re-machined artifact.

The surface equation is  evaluated at each point along the toolpath spiral, and each surface point is then offset by the tool  radius in the direction of the component of the outward normal vector which lay in the Ï�-z plane, as  described in Eq. 5a-6.  If slope-dependent errors are known from analysis of a setup artifact, they may  be compensated for during this step. After tool nose radius compensation, compensation for machine  axis misalignment, if known and desired, can be applied using Eq. 7.   à¢”áˆ¬Ô¦ àµŒ àµ†ß²Ý– áˆºß©Ç¡ ß¶áˆ» ß²ß© à£‹à·� àµ… à¢ à·œ    à¢”à·� àµŒ à¢”áˆ¬Ô¦ È�à¢”áˆ¬Ô¦È�àµ—   (5a)    (5b)  à¢�áˆ¬áˆ¬Ô¦ àµŒ à¢™áˆ¬Ô¦ àµ… à¢”áˆ¬Ô¦àµ«Ü´à¯–à¯§ àµ… Ý€Ü´à¯–à¯§áˆºß áˆ»àµ¯ àµŒ ÛƒÝƒà°˜Ç¡ Ýƒà°¥Ç¡ Ýƒà¯­Û„ (6)  à¢Žáˆ¬Ô¦ àµŒ à¢�áˆ¬áˆ¬Ô¦ àµ… Ýƒà°˜Â•Â‹Â� áˆºßœà¯«à¯­áˆ»à¢ à·œ (7)  Machining and Metrology of a Chalcogenide Glass Freeform Lens Pair Troutman et al. 675    3 Design and Manufacturing  The original Alvarez lens as documented in the patent (Alvarez, 1967) is described by two  identical cubic polynomial surfaces which are represented in rectilinear coordinates by Eq. 8, where A  and C are an Alvarez constant and a base height shift, respectively.  When these surfaces are placed  opposing each other with collocated origins, the composite thickness of the optical device is constant,  equivalent to a planar element with zero optical power.  If a small lateral shearing displacement, d, is  introduced between the surfaces along the x-axis, as illustrated in Figure 5, the composite is equivalent  to a plano-spherical element which can have either positive or negative optical power, depending on  shearing direction.  The effective focal length of such a physical system can be calculated from Eq. 9,  where n is the index of refraction of the lens material.

Such function is feasible by  using only a small subset of the working range of a cubic Alvarez pair, yet requires surfaces with  unnecessarily large peak to valley heights and material removal requirements.  To minimize surface  height and improve manufacturability, a freeform lens pair of 15 mm aperture diameter was designed  for a thermal imaging application using 14th order polynomial surfaces, such that at zero shear, the  system focal length is 77 mm and is adjustable from of 38.5 mm to positive infinity over a shear of  Â±1.8 mm.  The lens pair was constructed from 25 mm diameter discs of As40Se60 (trade name IRG 26)  chalcogenide glass.     Figure 5: Composite thickness of displaced cubic Alvarez surfaces.  The cutting mechanics experiments referenced and machining described hereafter were performed  using a Moore Nanotechnology 350FG ultraprecision machining center, which is located in a  vibration- and acoustically-isolated laboratory with temperature control to Â±0.1Â°C.  This machine can  perform conventional diamond turning and STS operations, and is equipped with five position- Machining and Metrology of a Chalcogenide Glass Freeform Lens Pair Troutman et al. 676    controlled axes and an auxiliary high speed micro-machining spindle.  It is capable of multi-axis  ultraprecision grinding and milling operations, and is equipped with both mist and flood coolant  systems which deliver mineral oil to the cutting zone as desired.  3.1 Machining Parameter Selection  Extensive cutting experiments in IRG 26 chalcogenide are presented in (Troutman, et al., 2015)  (Owen, et al., 2015).  From orthogonal turning investigations using zero-rake tooling, it is known that  this material does not cause appreciable tool wear, and exhibits a change in material removal  mechanism from a ductile, plastic deformation-dominated mode to a brittle, cracking-dominated mode  when undeformed chip thickness exceeds a value of approximately 600 nm at any location along the  tool nose.   To examine the effect of varying rake angle on cutting behavior, a sinusoidal test specimen  described by Eq. 10 was machined using the selected tool and appropriate cutting parameters to verify  that cutting remained in the ductile-dominated cutting regime for an effective rake angle range of Â±3Â°.   SWLI examination of the surface was performed at locations corresponding to effective rake extrema,  as shown in Figure 6.  Over the range of rake angles sampled, no fracture or surface damage was  apparent, compared to a small reference band machined in the brittle-dominated mode using more  aggressive parameters.

Clockwise from top-left: specimen; SWLI of -3Â°, 0Â°, +3Â°  effective rake region, and of brittle-dominated band for comparison.  Slope analysis from Eq. 2-3 of the surface to be machined indicated a maximum permissible tool  nose radius of 42 mm, a minimum required clearance angle of 1.5Â°, and that machining this part would  sweep over Î¸ = -1Â° to +3Â° with respect to Figure 2.  A controlled-waviness tool with nose radius of 1.5  mm, 7Â° clearance, and 0Â° top rake was selected for this machining process.  A target, though  optimistic, 20 nm part error stipulated a 13 Î¼m toolpath chord length between points, corresponding to  a 0.1Â° angular increment at the outer edge of the 15 mm diameter aperture.  From operator experience  and previous results, semi-aggressive rough machining parameters were chosen to increase material  Machining and Metrology of a Chalcogenide Glass Freeform Lens Pair Troutman et al. 677    removal rate by cutting in the brittle-dominated regime while remaining below the onset of  catastrophic material failure.  For finish machining, remaining within the ductile-dominated cutting  regime to leave a final surface of optical quality required a toolpath stepover of 6.5 Î¼m per revolution  using the selected tool at a depth of cut of 7.5 Î¼m.  However, a target surface finish of 1.3 nm Ra  further limited the finish cut to a smaller stepover of 2 Î¼m/rev.  The selected machining parameters are  summarized in Table 3.    3.2 Manufacturing of Optics  To enable pre-process mapping of tool waviness and machine axis misalignment and eliminate the  requirement of post-process workpiece measurement and error correction procedures, a 12 mm  diameter, 3Â° tilted flat was used to determine tool error properties: waviness and offset. The artifact  was first machined in OFHC copper using an uncompensated toolpath, assuming a perfectly circular  tool and zero offset errors.  The resulting artifact, which had an orientation flat on one side, was  measured, using a Zygo VeriFIRE ATZ, indicating a peak to valley error of 140 nm.  While this form  accuracy would have been sufficient for the intended 3-5 Î¼m IR application, a slight correction was  performed to demonstrate this methodology.  Although a controlled waviness tool was used, and  therefore no correctable waviness errors could be discerned, a slight cone-shaped error trend due to  spindle axis misalignment was observed.  This was compensated for and a new tilted flat was  machined. This artifact had a reduced peak to valley error of 110 nm.  Measurements of both  uncompensated and compensated tilted flats are shown in Figure 7.    Table 3: Selected machining parameters for IRG 26 freeform lens pair.  Parameter Roughing Finishing  Depth of cut 25 Î¼m 7.5 Î¼m  Stepover per revolution 25 Î¼m 2.0 Î¼m  Maximum undeformed chip thickness 4.5 Î¼m 0.2 Î¼m  Rotational rate 16.66 rpm 16.66 rpm  Coolant method (mineral oil) Mist Flood    Toolpath generation for the freeform lens pair was performed in MATLABÂ“ from Eq. 6-8 using  compensation for the tool and spindle errors determined from the tilted flat.  Each IRG 26 workpiece  was mounted on a vacuum chuck and machined to leave a 15 mm diameter pedestal above a 1.5 mm  thick, 25 mm diameter base.  After allowing 12 hours for the machine to reach thermal equilibrium,  the functional surface was machined using 15 rough machining passes and 4 finishing passes to  remove any resulting surface damage, in accordance with Table 3.  After machining of the optical  surfaces, mounting slots and an alignment flat were machined using a solid carbide endmill, resulting  in slight edge chipping around these features that did not affect the clear aperture of the optic. A  segment of the generated toolpath and the final optics, which were expected to have similar form  errors to the compensated tilted flat, are shown in Figure 8.

Figure 8: Toolpath segment and machined freeform variable-focus lens pair.  4 Metrology and Testing  4.1 Metrology of Optical Surface  The entire optical surface was examined using a Zygo ZeGage Plus coherence scanning white light  interferometer (SWLI) which acquired 121 surface maps using a 5x Michelson objective with 1.67  mm square field of view.  The surface maps overlapped by 30% and were stitched together using Zygo  Mx software to form a composite map of the surface.  Data voids existed in regions where local part  slope exceeded the Â±2.5Â° acceptance angle of the objective.  The measured and target points were  registered into a common coordinate frame using a least squares minimization routine. When  compared to the optical prescription, the peak to valley form error was 1.726 Î¼m with a standard  deviation of 0.100 Î¼m.  Additional evaluation at 20x magnification indicated surface finish of 6 nm  rms at six locations on the part.    Further surface metrology was performed using an OptoPro UltraSurf five-axis noncontact  measurement system with a chromatic confocal probe.  This probe, which uses a visible light source  Machining and Metrology of a Chalcogenide Glass Freeform Lens Pair Troutman et al. 679    and has a Â±25Â° acceptance angle, was an appropriate choice for metrology of this mildly-sloped IRG  26 freeform, which is opaque at wavelengths below 1.1 Î¼m. Single-point measurements were taken  over the entire aperture at a spacing of approximately 50 Î¼m, registered to the target points, and a 6x6  pixel moving average filter was applied.  When compared to the surface prescription, part peak to  valley form error of 1.660 Î¼m with a standard deviation of 0.256 Î¼m was indicated.  The results of this  measurement are compared to those of the stitched SWLI measurement in Figure 9.  While the uncertainties of these area-based and point-based metrology techniques are difficult to  estimate, both measurements exhibit similar error shape and magnitudes.  Although both techniques  suggest similar part form, indicated errors may have similar uncertainties due to misalignment  inherent to the point cloud registration.  Although these metrology systems differ, misalignment errors  are correlated, as the same algorithm for point cloud registration was used for both measurements. The  effect of misalignment could be reduced if fiducials, for example three concave spherical recesses at  known locations, were machined outside the clear aperture but concurrent with the manufacture of the  functional surface.  Although these form deviations of approximately Â±0.5 waves at 2 Î¼m exceed the  levels predicted by the tilted flat setup artifact used for pre-process error mapping, they remain  acceptable for the intended application.  While these metrology results indicate an upper bound on  form error, additional work is necessary reduce the uncertainty in the measurement procedure before  the true machining errors can be quantified.  An evaluation of instrument-related error sources, for  example slope-dependent errors as determined using self-calibration techniques like the random ball  test (Zhou, et al., 2013) as well as further analysis of the point cloud registration algorithm would  assist with identification of error and uncertainty sources.       Figure 9: Stitched SWLI error map (left), OptiPro Ultrasurf error map (right).  4.2 Functional Performance Evaluation  Functional testing of the variable-focus system was conducted after manufacturing and metrology.  The optics were each mounted to three-axis optical stages using custom-built brackets and mounting  Machining and Metrology of a Chalcogenide Glass Freeform Lens Pair Troutman et al. 680    rings.  The translation stages were mounted, as shown in Figure 10, to a fixturing plate atop a Newport  ILS linear motion stage, which was placed in front of an Indigo Phoenix thermal imaging camera.   This nitrogen-cooled camera has 30 Î¼m square pixels and detects wavelengths from 3 Î¼m to 5 Î¼m.   The setup allowed a controlled shear between the two optics to be introduced producing the change in  focal length predicted by Eq. 10.   A hot plate, used as a thermal radiation source, was located along  the optical axis of the camera, approximately 2.5 m away, outside the field of view of the shown  photograph.  After assembling with a 400 Î¼m gap between lenses and performing preliminary  alignment, the entire lens assembly was translated on the linear motion stage along the optical axis of  the camera.  At each value of the shear the optic was translated until the best focus position was  determined.  The process was repeated three times for shear displacements from -0.8 mm to +1.0 mm  in 0.1 mm increments.        Figure 10: Experimental apparatus for functional testing of variable-focus freeform lens pair.      Figure 11: Freeform variable-focus lens pair focal length change with lateral shear.  Performance of the system clearly demonstrated the variable-focus principle.  Focal length of the  STS-machined system is compared in Figure 11 to theoretical values as well as results from repeating  this functional testing procedure using identical optics machined by a freeform milling operation.   Machining and Metrology of a Chalcogenide Glass Freeform Lens Pair Troutman et al. 681    Selected images of the hot plate are shown as well.  Over the majority of the test range, both  theoretical and milled focal lengths lie within the measurement uncertainty.  For large negative shear  displacements, deviations from predicted values are larger due to increased difficulty in precisely  finding optimum focus due to increased depth of field and reduced magnification at these points.  5 Discussion  Machining parameters for the manufacture of two IRG 26 (As40Se60 chalcogenide glass) freeform  optics for a variable-focus thermal imaging system were chosen from the results of simplified cutting  experiments.  Toolpath was generated analytically from the surface prescription using MATLABÂ“  software which is capable of compensating for tool shape errors and machine misalignments, and the  optics were manufactured using the slow tool servo method.  While there are many challenges  associated with the metrology of freeform surfaces which make uncertainty estimation difficult,  measurements of these optics performed with both area-based and point-based techniques indicated  similar form.  Uncertainty sources attributable to point cloud registration could be reduced by  including appropriate alignment fiducials on the part, allowing the true machining errors to be more  readily deduced.  The assembled optical system performed as designed during functional testing, with  similar performance to an identical system manufactured by ultraprecision diamond milling.  There are  challenges inherent to measurement of freeform surfaces due to instrument limitations and lack of  appropriate standards.  It is certain that growing demand for freeform optics will continue to drive  advances in process development and metrology.  6 Acknowledgements  This research was partially supported by the NSF I/UCRC Center for Freeform Optics (IIP- 1338877 and IIP-1338898) and the NSF grant CMMI-1437225.

A methodology has been developed for pre-process mapping of, and compensation for, predictable error sources such as tool waviness and machine misalignment, reducing necessity for typical post-process workpiece error correction procedures. This methodology is implemented for manufacture of a chalcogenide glass freeform lens pair for a variable-focus thermal imaging application.
