               Abstract
               
                  Photoinduced changes in the mechanical properties of Ge-Se chalcogenide glasses produced by sub-band gap energy are studied by microindentation. The results show that the irradiation leads to an increase of the mechanical properties exactly module of Young and the hardness with a decrease of the viscosity in the case of the low intensities laser and a decrease of the mechanical properties with an increase of the viscosity in the case of the high intensities of irradiation.
