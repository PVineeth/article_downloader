               Abstract
               
                  We present a study of mid-infrared photoluminescence in the wavelength range 3.5–5.5μm emitted from Pr3+: GeAsGaSe core/GeAsGaSe cladding chalcogenide fiber. The Pr3+ doped fiber optic preform is fabricated using extrusion and is successfully drawn to low optical loss, step-index fiber. Broadband mid-infrared photoluminescence is observed from the fiber, both under 1.55μm or 1.94μm wavelength excitation. Absorption, and emission, spectra of bulk glass and fiber are presented. Luminescent lifetimes are measured for the fiber and the Judd–Ofelt parameters are calculated. The radiative transition rates calculated from Judd–Ofelt theory are compared with experimental lifetimes. The observed strong broadband emission suggests that this type of fiber is a good candidate for further development to realize both fiber lasers and amplified spontaneous emission fiber sources in the mid-infrared region.
