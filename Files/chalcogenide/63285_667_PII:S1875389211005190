               Abstract
               
                  In order to simulate the precision molding process, the viscoelastic properties of chalcogenide glasses under high temperatures were investigated. Thermomechanical analysis were performed to measure and analysis the thermomechanical properties of chalcogenide glasses. The creep responses of the glasses at different temperatures were obtained. Finite element analysis was applied for the simulation of the molding processes. The simulation results were in consistence with previously reported experiment results. Stress concentration and evolution during the molding processes was also described with the simulation results.
