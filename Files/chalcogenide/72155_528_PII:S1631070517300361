               Abstract
               
                  In this paper are described the different research activities that led to the awarding of the Lamb prize by the French Academy of Sciences in order to promote research work on the national defense of France. This research concerns the development of infrared materials for night vision and the development of thermal imagers useful for defense, but also for civilian applications. The contribution has been particularly innovative in different sectors: broadening of chalcogenide glasses window of transparency, IR glass-ceramics with high thermomechanical properties, and the design of a new way of synthesis of these materials by a mechanical process.
