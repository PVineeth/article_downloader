               Abstract
               
                  GexS100-x glasses with a wide compositional range of 10 ≤ x ≤ 43 (mol%) were prepared for the investigation and understanding of compositional trends of physical properties and structural features in this binary chalcogenide glasses. Both of mechanical and thermal properties were studied by the techniques of micro-indentation, resonant ultrasound spectroscopy, dilatometer, and DSC. The compositional evolution of network structure was discussed with the detailed investigation of Raman spectra. The thermo-mechanical properties, including hardness, thermal expansion coefficient, and elastic modulus, are firstly studied systematically in this binary glass system. Together with structural model theories, the correlation between thermo-mechanical properties and network structure of GexS100-x glasses is established. This work further clarify the composition-structure-property relationship of chalcogenide glasses, which would contribute to the compositional design of novel glasses with elaborate properties.
