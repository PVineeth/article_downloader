               Abstract
               
                  Chalcogenide glasses have attracted much attention for the realization of photonic components owing to their outstanding optical properties in the mid-infrared (MIR) region. However, relatively few refractive index dispersion data are presently available for these glasses at MIR wavelengths. This paper presents a mini review of methods we have both used and developed to determine the refractive indices and thermo-optic coefficients of chalcogenide glasses at MIR wavelengths, and is supported by new results. The mini review should be useful to both new and established researchers in the chalcogenide glass field and fields of MIR optics, fiber-optics and waveguides. Three groups of methods are distinguished: (1) spectroscopic ellipsometry, (2) prism-based methods, and (3) methods using Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) transmission data. The mini review is supported by a brief discussion of refractive index models.
