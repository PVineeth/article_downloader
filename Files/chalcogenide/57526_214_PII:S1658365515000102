                      chalcogenide glasses were studied using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). The temperature dependence of the glass transition activation energy was determined using an isoconversional kinetic analysis. The compositional trend of the activation energy provides evidence of a transition from floppy to rigid network regimes separated by an intermediate phase. The variations of the activation energy with respect to temperature at various compositions were presented and discussed.
