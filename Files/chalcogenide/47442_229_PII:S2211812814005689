               Abstract
               
                  Optical, structural, morphological and photoelectrochemical properties were investigated of ternary MoBi2Se5 thin film prepared by simple arrested precipitation technique (APT). The precursors used were molybdenum, bismuth, triethanolamine complexes (TEA) along with organic additives. Ammonium molybdate, Bismuth nitrate and sodium selenosulphite were used as sources of Mo4+, Bi3+ and Se2− ions. The optical band gap of thin film was estimated to be 1.78eV. X-ray diffraction data reveals that the grown MoBi2Se5 thin film was highly nanocrystalline with orthorhombic structure. Scanning electron microscopy studies reveal that porous layer having elongated fibrous morphology with high surface area. The film was obtained with a well-defined composition, very close to the expected one. PEC application of prepared thin film were checked in Sulphide / Poly sulphide electrolyte which revealed that MoBi2Se5 thin film deposited on FTO coated glass exhibited maximum values of fill factor (FF) and conversion efficiency (η) with n type semiconductor nature.
