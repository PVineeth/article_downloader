                      were investigated. The glass transition and crystallization temperature of the synthesized samples was measured by non-isothermal DSC measurements. Amorphous thin films of Ga25Se75−x

                      thin films in the temperature range 358–388K is studied. As-prepared and annealed thin films were characterized by X-ray diffraction, field emission scanning electron microscopy, energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy and optical absorption. Thermal annealing was found to be accompanied by structural effects, which in turn, lead to changes in the optical constants. The optical absorption coefficient (α) for as-deposited and thermally annealed films was calculated from the absorbance data. From the knowledge of absorption coefficient at different wavelengths, the optical band gap (E
                     g) was calculated for all compositions of Ga25Se75−x

                      thin films results in a gradual decrease in the indirect optical gap, this behavior can be explained as increased tailing. The decrease in optical band gap and an increase in absorption coefficient and extinction coefficient with thermal annealing can be attributed to transformation from amorphous to crystalline phase.
