               Abstract
               
                  Layered Pnictides are proven to be a great reservoir for superconductors in the past and ternary zirconium pnictide chalcogenides of ZrXY-type (X = P, As; Y = S, Se) might be a platform for new superconductors. The superconducting properties of carefully grown (chemical transport reaction) single crystals of ZrP1.54S0.46 with a transition temperature of T
                     c = 3.5K are investigated. This compound (PbFCl structure type) contains square planar nets: One of the nets is completely occupied (no vacancies) by P, the other one characterized by a random distribution of P and S (full occupation: no vacancies). Besides zero-field-cooling (zfc), field-cooling (fc), and remanent moment (rem) measurements, especially magnetization and ac susceptibility measurements are performed. A nearly ideal type-II behavior with a Ginzburg-Landau parameter κ = 24 is found. The magnetization curves between B
                     c1 and B
                     c2 for increasing field are in excellent agreement with theoretical calculations performed by E. H. Brandt based on the Ginzburg-Landau theory. The decreasing branches of the magnetization curves are asymmetric about the field axis indicating weak pinning and also large diamagnetic behavior.
