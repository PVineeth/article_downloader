               Abstract
               
                  The present work reports the results of non-isothermal DSC measurements on some Se-based ternary glasses for evaluation of activation of glass transition. The activation energy of glass transition (E
                     
                        g
                     ) is determined using Augis–Bennett's relation, which is basically derived for amorphous to crystalline phase transition. Moynihan's relation which is derived on the concept of thermal relaxation and is basically used for glass transition is also used for determination of E
                     
                        g
                      values. We have observed that E
                     
                        g
                      values obtained from Augis–Bennett's relation are in admirable agreement with the E
                     
                        g
                      values which are obtained using Moynihan's relation.
