               Abstract
               
                  Intense efforts have been devoted to the synthesis of heterogeneous nanocomposites consisting of chalcogenide semiconductors and noble metals, which usually exhibit enhanced properties owing to the synergistic effect between their different material domains. Tailoring the structure of the metal domains in the nanocomposites may lead to further improvements of its performance for a given application. This review therefore highlights the strategies based on a structural conversion process for the fabrication of nanocomposites consisting of chalcogenide semiconductors and noble metals with various internal structures, e.g., hollow or cage-bell. This strategy relies on a unique inside-out diffusion phenomenon of Ag in core-shell nanoparticles with Ag residing at core or inner shell region. In the presence of sulfur or selenium precursors, the diffused Ag are converted into Ag2S or Ag2Se, which is connected with the remaining noble metal parts, forming nanocomposites consisting of silver chalcogenide and noble metal nanoparticles with hollow or cage-bell structures. We would focus on the introduction of the fundamentals, principles, electrocatalytic applications as well as perspectives of the chalcogenide semiconductor-noble metal nanocomposites derived from their core-shell precursors so as to provide the readers insights in designing efficient nanocomposites for electrocatalysis.
