               Abstract
               
                  Chalcogenide glasses has been one of the indispensable materials in the long-wave infrared athermalized optical design field based on its excellent optical performance. However, it is difficult to create high-quality optical surface by grinding and polishing process because of its instability mechanical and thermodynamic properties. In this paper, the Chemical Mechanical Grinding (CMG) process that for obtaining high-quality optical surface is proposed, and a kind of chalcogenide glasses Ge10As40Se50 is selected for the CMG experimental study. First, the effects of grinding tools’ materials is studied, the roughness measurement results show that the cooper grinding tools with the lower hardness and higher Poisson’s ratio can obtain best surface roughness. Then, different grinding with different chemicals is collected, and the CMG process is carried on ultilized cooper grinding tool. The results of CMG process show that the materials removal and surface quality will be change with the alkali and oxidant concentration of the fluids. While the concentration of H2O2 is 10wt%, the materials removal rate is enhanced and the best surface roughness is got.
