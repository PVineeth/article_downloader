               Abstract
               
                  Chalcogenide glasses has been one of the indispensable materials in the long-wave infrared athermalized optical design field based on its excellent optical performance. However, it is difficult to create high-quality optical surface by grinding and polishing process because of its instability mechanical and thermodynamic properties. In this paper, the Chemical Mechanical Grinding (CMG) process that for obtaining high-quality optical surface is proposed, and a kind of chalcogenide glasses Ge10As40Se50 is selected for the CMG experimental study. First, the effects of grinding tools’ materials is studied, the roughness measurement results show that the cooper grinding tools with the lower hardness and higher Poisson’s ratio can obtain best surface roughness. Then, different grinding with different chemicals is collected, and the CMG process is carried on ultilized cooper grinding tool. The results of CMG process show that the materials removal and surface quality will be change with the alkali and oxidant concentration of the fluids. While the concentration of H2O2 is 10wt%, the materials removal rate is enhanced and the best surface roughness is got.

Tel.: +33 3 87 37 54 30; E-mail address: paul.stief@ensam.eu Abstract  In todayâ€™s business environment, the trend towards more product variety and customization is unbroken. Due to this development, the need of  agile and reconfigurable production systems emerged to cope with various products and product families. To design and optimize production systems as well as to choose the optimal product matches, product analysis methods are needed. Indeed, most of the known methods aim to  analyze a product or one product family on the physical level. Different product families, however, may differ largely in terms of the number and  nature of components. This fact impedes an efficient comparison and choice of appropriate product family combinations for the production system. A new methodology is proposed to analyze existing products in view of their functional and physical architecture. The aim is to cluster these products in new assembly oriented product families for the optimization of existing assembly lines and the creation of future reconfigurable  assembly systems. Based on Datum Flow Chain, the physical structure of the products is analyzed. Functional subassemblies are identified, and  a functional analysis is performed. Moreover, a hybrid functional and physical architecture graph (HyFPAG) is the output which depicts the  similarity between product families by providing design support to both, production system planners and product designers. An illustrative example of a nail-clipper is used to explain the proposed methodology. An industrial case study on two product families of steering columns of  thyssenkrupp Presta France is then carried out to give a first industrial evaluation of the proposed approach.

Keywords: Assembly; Design method; Family identification 1. Introduction  Due to the fast development in the domain of  communication and an ongoing trend of digitization and digitalization, manufacturing enterprises are facing important challenges in todayâ€™s market environments: a continuing tendency towards reduction of product development times and shortened product lifecycles. In addition, there is an increasing demand of customization, being at the same time in a global  competition with competitors all over the world. This trend,  which is inducing the development from macro to micro  markets, results in diminished lot sizes due to augmenting product varieties (high-volume to low-volume production) [1].  To cope with this augmenting variety as well as to be able to identify possible optimization potentials in the existing production system, it is important to have a precise knowledge of the product range and characteristics manufactured and/or  assembled in this system. In this context, the main challenge in modelling and analysis is now not only to cope with single  products, a limited product range or existing product families, but also to be able to analyze and to compare products to define new product families. It can be observed that classical existing product families are regrouped in function of clients or features. However, assembly oriented product families are hardly to find.  On the product family level, products differ mainly in two main characteristics: (i) the number of components and (ii) the type of components (e.g. mechanical, electrical, electronical).  Classical methodologies considering mainly single products  or solitary, already existing product families analyze the product structure on a physical level (components level) which  causes difficulties regarding an efficient definition and comparison of different product families.

Introduction  Chalcogenide glasses is a semiconductor material with  amorphous structure formed by introducing electronegativity  metal or nonmetal elements based on S, Se and Te. [1]It has  fast ptical respons  speed, wide infrared tr nsmission range,  high infrared transmittance, low optical loss, lower phonon  energy, higher linear and nonlinear refractive index, good  chemical stability, excellent heat-poor stability performance  and unique photosensitive properties such as excellent  performance. It is widely used in infrared thermal imaging  systems, energy transfer, infrared sensing, non-linear optical  system, near-field microscopic imaging, optical frequency  multiplier, inorganic lithography, holographic storage tool,  infrared night vision and other technical fields. It is regarded  as the most promising material for non-linear or mid-infrared  optical devices. [2][3]  The most important is that it has a very  small thermal coefficient (dn/dT), which is an indispensable  material for the long wave infrared passive athermalized  optical system.  Due to the wide application of chalcogenide glasses,  reasonable processing techniques need to be studied. The  research on its optical surface grinding technology is a very  important aspect of processing. Currently used in  chalcogenide glasses optical processing methods are mainly  classic polishing process, single point diamond turning (SPDT)  and Precision Molding Technology. Processing by the  traditional method is conducive to raising surface accuracy,  but it will last many surface defects on the surface and can not  be eliminated effectively. Pitting and scratches will remain on  the polished surface even polishing with 0.1Î¼m grains. The  surface processed by SPDT can improve efficiency, turning  knife pattern will be remained yet which is connected to the  process parameters. Molding helps to batch production, but  still can not solve the problem of surface defects. Therefore,  how to obtain a high quality chalcogenide glasses optical  surface efficiently and stably is a problem to be solved  urgently.  In order to improve the surface quality of the chalcogenide  glasses optical surface effectively, a set of process methods of  grinding and polishing need to be studied.

Introductio   Chalcogenide glasses is a semiconductor material with  amorphous structure formed by introducing electronegativity  metal or nonmetal elements based on S, Se and Te.

There is a close relationship between  the two steps.  This article focus on the grinding process, based on the  traditional processing technology, and introduce chemicals to  assist the grinding. Experimental study the effect of materials  of grinding tools and concentrations of hydrogen peroxide  (H2O2) and sodium hydroxide (NaOH) on the grinding surface  and try to select the most reasonable grinding method in the  end.  2. Experiment design  In this paper, the experimental study mainly consists of  two parts. The influence of different materials grinding tools  and different concentrations of H2O2 and NaOH are study  respectively. The Ge10As40Se50 (IG-4) are selected to be the  sample. The experiments in this paper are finished by  polishing machine under the same parameters.  2.1 Experiment design of different material grinding tools   In the first part, the effects of grinding tools of three  different materials: copper, steel and borosilicate glass, on the  refining effect are studied. Three types of grinding tools has  been machined to the same geometric dimensioning before  the test: two wide 4 mm ring grooves of Î¦80 mm and Î¦40  mm were set in the effective range of Î¦120 mm. The exist of  the grooves makes the larger abrasive particles or grinding  clastic removed during the grinding process timely and  prevents large scale damage on the surface. The picture of  three different materials grinding tools are shown in Figure 1.        (a) cooper       (b) borosilicate glass                                 (c) steel  Fig. 1.  Three grinding tools used in this paperã€‚(a)  cooper, (b)  borosilicate  glass ,(c) steel  The materials of grinding tools and machine parameters in  this part are shown in Table 1. The surface is pretreated by a  size of W28 silicon carbide grinding fluid grinding for a  sufficient time to make the surface of the workpieces ground  sufficiently under neutral condition. Then use W10 particle  size of silicon carbide grinding liquid for further refining  treatment in the same condition, and analyze the surface  roughness finally.

Experimental Study on Chemical reactions of GeAsSe.(a) Soak in  NaOH (pH=14) for 4hours, the solution is reddish brown.(b) Soak in H2O2  (30wt%) liquid for 4hours, the surface of the sample showed a reddish brown  color, and a white precipitate formed.(c) There are no obvious phenomenon  that immersion in H2SO4 (pH=0) for 72hours.  A prior study of the state of chemical reactions between  acid, alkali, oxidant and GeAsSe (IG-4) has been done. The  test results shown in Figure 2. The results show that there are  obvious phenomenon when the GeAsSe soaking in the  environment of NaOH (pH=14) or H2O2 (30wt%) for four  174 Dongbai Xue et al. / Procedia CIRP 71 (2018) 172â€“176  Author name / Procedia CIRP 00 (2018) 000â€“000  3  hours. Whereas there still no obvious phenomenon that stay in  the liquid of H2SO4 (pH=0) for 72 hours. It can be judged as  that there are no chemical reaction occurred.   According to the phenomenon shows in the Figure 2, this  paper choose H2O2 and NaOH to do the experiments. The test  was formulated with H2O2 (30wt%, 20wt%, 10wt%, 5wt%,  3wt%, 1wt%) and NaOH (pH = 14, 11, 9). Similar to the first  part, the same surface condition is grinded with silicon  carbide of W28 size in a neutral environment and then  grinded by W10-sized silicon carbide of a grinding liquid with  different additive components to compare the final surface  roughness in the end.  The tests involved in this part are carried out on a machine  tool and set to the same machine parameters (Table 2). The  pressure is on the machine weight.

And the  surfaces roughness (Ra and Rq) are tested by Taly Hobson  PGI 2540 profilometer.  3. Results and Disscussions  The surface roughness of fine grinding is mainly related to  the material of the grinding tool, the type and size of the  abrasives, the composition of the grinding liquid and other  factors. The effects of three kinds of materials of grinding  tools, including steel, borosilicate glass and copper are studied.  Cooper tool shows a better performance. On the basis of the  copper grinding tool, different concentration of hydrogen  peroxide (H2O2) and sodium hydroxide (NaOH) are added to  the liquid. The change of the surface roughness are reported  and the comparison analysis of power spectral density  distribution (PSD) are conducted.   3.1. The Relationship between Grinding tools Materials and  Surface Roughness  Table 3 and Figure 3 show the surface roughness of fine  grinded by silicon carbide size of W10 with three different  materials grinding tools. Copper tools preforms better than  steel and borosilicate glass as the grinding tools on the fine  grinding of the chalcogenide glasses. It reveals that the  grinding surface quality of chalcogenide glasses is related to  the hardness and poisson's ratio of the tools mainly. The  hardness of the tool is smaller, the poisson's ratio is greater,  the more prone to be deformed. So that it is convenient for  abrasive to embed in the surface of the tools. The grinding  mechanism of cooper tool is closer to the fixed abrasive  grinding, reducing the impact of particle size heterogeneity on  the refining surface, the smaller surface roughness is obtained.

The fracture mechanism can be  characterized by a conchoidal surface, linear temporal  removal rate, and time-independent surface roughness. For  plastic scratching mechanism the initial stages are as the same  as the fracture mechanism, but in a short time change to be  characterized by a relatively smooth surface with  superimposed scratches, a monotonically decreasing temporal  removal rate, and a monotonically decreasing surface  roughness. [4]  The microstructure test by SEM can not reflect the  longitudinal depth information of the surface directly. It can  be seen in the Figure 3 that there are no significant differences  between the surface ground by silicon carbide (W10) grinding  liquid with H2O2 (10wt%) and NaOH (pH=9). But a clearly  conchoidal surfaces are observed, verifying that the grinding  removal mechanism is fracture removal under the conditions  set in these experiments.  Evolution of surface roughness   According to the first part, the cooper tool is selected in the  second part experiments. Not only due to its performance in  the first part is better, but also the chemical stability.  Based on the copper grinding tool, change the chemical  composition of the grinding fluid furtherly. The results of the  CMP is shown as the Table4, Figure5, Table5, Figure 6. With  the change of the concentration, the removal rate increase  significantly. The changes of surface roughness Ra and Rq  with the concentration meet the tendency of decreasing first  and then increasing. When the concentration of H2O2 is 10wt%  and the pH of NaOH is 9, the surface roughness Ra and Rq  attain a minimum value.

PSD is a method to describe and  evaluate optical surfaces more completely and intuitively  based on Fourier analysis. The spatial frequency distribution  information of the surface errors can be obtained.  In this paper, one-dimensional PSD is used to analyze the  surface quality of the grinding surface. Comparing the power  spectral density distribution curves of the surface under  different experiment conditions (Fig 7 a, b, c). The  distribution integrally is consistent with the value of the  surface roughness. After adding 10wt% H2O2 or pH=9 NaOH,  the curve can be smoothed obviously. As shown in Figure 7 d,  The addition of pH =9 NaOH and 10 wt% H2O2 can  effectively reduce the low frequency and medium frequency  roughness, but can not be clearly distinguished. The addition  of 10% H2O2 gives a better high frequency distribution. For  the grinding process, the main purpose is to reduce the surface  roughness and to reduce the thickness of the damage layer.  Thus 10wt% H2O2 for grinding process has a greater  performance improvement.  Through this experimental studies can propose a new  grinding method for Chalcogenide glasses that is the chemical  mechanical grinding (CMP). By adding 10wt% H2O2 in the  liquid can improve the materials removal rate, improve the  surface roughness, improve the processing efficiency and  facilitate the effective connection with the subsequent  polishing process at the same time.

The power spectral density distribution.(a) shows that the PSD of  different grinding tools.(b) shows the PSD of different concentration of  H2O2,which grinded with cooper.(c) is the PSD of different concentration of  NaOH, which grinding with cooper.(d) is used to show the Cooper tools with  10wt% H2O2 has the best performance in this paper.   4. Conclusions  In the paper, the influence of grinding toolsâ€™ materials and  the CMG processing of chalcogenide glasses were studied.  The grinding efficiency and the surface quality were  improved by adding H2O2 and NaOH in the grinding fluid. A  new CMP process which through adding 10wt% H2O2 in the  fluid with copper grinding tool has been obtained based on the  CMG experiments. The grinding removal mechanism also has  been verified. In the future, for obtain high quality optical  surface of chalcogenide glasses, the Chemical Mechanical  Polishing (CMP) experiments will be carried out, like the  studies in this paper. So that a stable grinding and polishing  process will be obtained.  References  [1]  Dai SX, Chen HG, Li MZ,et al. Chalcogenide glasses and their infared  optical applications.

However, it is difficult to create high-quality optical surface by grinding and polishing process because of its instability mechanical and thermodynamic properties. In this paper, the Chemical Mechanical Grinding (CMG) process that for obtaining high-quality optical surface is proposed, and a kind of chalcogenide glasses Ge<ce:inf loc="post">10</ce:inf>As<ce:inf loc="post">40</ce:inf>Se<ce:inf loc="post">50</ce:inf> is selected for the CMG experimental study. First, the effects of grinding tools’ materials is studied, the roughness measurement results show that the cooper grinding tools with the lower hardness and higher Poisson’s ratio can obtain best surface roughness. Then, different grinding with different chemicals is collected, and the CMG process is carried on ultilized cooper grinding tool. The results of CMG process show that the materials removal and surface quality will be change with the alkali and oxidant concentration of the fluids. While the concentration of H<ce:inf loc="post">2</ce:inf>O<ce:inf loc="post">2</ce:inf> is 10wt%, the materials removal rate is enhanced and the best surface roughness is got.</ce:simple-para>
