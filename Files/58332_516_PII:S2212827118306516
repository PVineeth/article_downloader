               Abstract
               
                  Chalcogenide glass (ChG) Ge22Se58As20 is a significant material in infrared optical systems, and it is usually machined by ultraprecision single point diamond turning (SPDT) for aspheric lens and freeform surface. However, as a soft brittle material, the surface is easily cracked during cutting. With the increasing demand for imaging quality, the surface integrity of chalcogenide glasses becomes increasingly important. This paper proposes a method to achieve high-precision and high-efficiency aspheric lens by SPDT. First, to study the material properties, the Vickers hardness of Ge22Se58As20 is tested, and the element components and microstructure are analysed by EDS. Second, through orthogonal cutting, the critical cutting thickness of the brittle-ductile transition is tested to be 1.2 μm and the minimum depth of cut for chip formation of 100 nm is identified. The material removal rate under ductile machining in face turning was calculated. Finally, by optimizing the machining condition, an aspheric lens with surface roughness of Ra 6.47 nm and form error of PV 120.82 nm was successfully fabricated.

Tel.: +33 3 87 37 54 30; E-mail address: paul.stief@ensam.eu Abstract  In todayâ€™s business environment, the trend towards more product variety and customization is unbroken. Due to this development, the need of  agile and reconfigurable production systems emerged to cope with various products and product families. To design and optimize production systems as well as to choose the optimal product matches, product analysis methods are needed. Indeed, most of the known methods aim to  analyze a product or one product family on the physical level. Different product families, however, may differ largely in terms of the number and  nature of components. This fact impedes an efficient comparison and choice of appropriate product family combinations for the production system. A new methodology is proposed to analyze existing products in view of their functional and physical architecture. The aim is to cluster these products in new assembly oriented product families for the optimization of existing assembly lines and the creation of future reconfigurable  assembly systems. Based on Datum Flow Chain, the physical structure of the products is analyzed. Functional subassemblies are identified, and  a functional analysis is performed. Moreover, a hybrid functional and physical architecture graph (HyFPAG) is the output which depicts the  similarity between product families by providing design support to both, production system planners and product designers. An illustrative example of a nail-clipper is used to explain the proposed methodology. An industrial case study on two product families of steering columns of  thyssenkrupp Presta France is then carried out to give a first industrial evaluation of the proposed approach.

Keywords: Assembly; Design method; Family identification 1. Introduction  Due to the fast development in the domain of  communication and an ongoing trend of digitization and digitalization, manufacturing enterprises are facing important challenges in todayâ€™s market environments: a continuing tendency towards reduction of product development times and shortened product lifecycles. In addition, there is an increasing demand of customization, being at the same time in a global  competition with competitors all over the world. This trend,  which is inducing the development from macro to micro  markets, results in diminished lot sizes due to augmenting product varieties (high-volume to low-volume production) [1].  To cope with this augmenting variety as well as to be able to identify possible optimization potentials in the existing production system, it is important to have a precise knowledge of the product range and characteristics manufactured and/or  assembled in this system. In this context, the main challenge in modelling and analysis is now not only to cope with single  products, a limited product range or existing product families, but also to be able to analyze and to compare products to define new product families. It can be observed that classical existing product families are regrouped in function of clients or features. However, assembly oriented product families are hardly to find.  On the product family level, products differ mainly in two main characteristics: (i) the number of components and (ii) the type of components (e.g. mechanical, electrical, electronical).  Classical methodologies considering mainly single products  or solitary, already existing product families analyze the product structure on a physical level (components level) which  causes difficulties regarding an efficient definition and comparison of different product families.

Introduction  Infrared thermal imaging technology has a very broad  demand in both military and civilian application fields. For  instance, infrared guided weapon, warning, night vision, and  nondestructive detection. Chalcogenide glass (ChG) began to  be used as an optical device in infrared system in 1950s [1],  which had been widely applied to replace single crystal  germanium because of its high infrared transmittance, low cost,  continuous adjustable composition and small change of  refractive index with temperature since then [2].

After decades of researches, there were new  continuous theories and discoveries about various brittle  materials.   Jia P [8] recognized that BK7 glass brittle-ductile transition  depth was 0.502 Î¼m by scratching test, and suggested that the  value of the critical depth of cut increased with the  concentration of boric acid solution. Yan J [9] showed that by  using slow tool servo method a form error of ~300 nm PV and  surface roughness of ~6 nm Sa spherical microlens array were  successfully fabricated. Fang [10] provided an approach to  machining smooth freeform surfaces with rectangular aperture  via ultraprecision turning. Surface topographic details showed  that form error of a micron level and surface roughness of 5.41  nm had been achieved. Unlike brittle hard materials, the ChG  has a much lower hardness, and the defects must be controlled  by cutting below the critical cutting depth to avoid brittle  fracture, and at the same time, the material should be removed  above the minimum cutting thickness for chip formation at the  region of ploughing. In order to achieve high precision optical  surface at the high efficiency by SPDT, it is necessary to  further study this kind of soft brittle material.  In this paper, a kind of far infrared glass Ge22Se58As20  (IRG202) is studied. The machining mechanics of  Ge22Se58As20 is principally investigated, and then the brittle- ductile transition phenomenon and the ploughing phenomenon  are observed successively during cutting ChG. The critical  cutting thickness and the minimum cutting thickness are tested  through orthogonal cutting. Accordingly, the uncut chip  thickness (tuct) to achieve ductile regime machining is acquired.  Finally, an optical surface of aspheric lens is achieved by face  turning at a high material removal rate.  2. Material description and testing  2.1. Vickers hardness test  As presented in Eq. (1), Lambropoulos [11] obtained the  formula of the depth of central crack c according to the theory  of the indentation fracture mechanics and the definition of the  fracture toughness of the material, where H is hardness that  affects the critical condition in ultraprecision machining brittle  materials. First, the value of hardness was measured by a  Vickers hardness tester (AHVD-1000, SIOOM, China). The  sample was polished and ultrasonically cleaned to remove the  impurities on the surface. Then, a load of 0.245 N was applied  to the sample and kept for 20 s. The test repeated at 5 different  locations of the sample randomly, and the values were shown  in Fig. 1. The average value is 175.14 HV which is much lower  than that of silica glass [12].   ï€¨ ï€© 2/3(1 )2/3 4/92/3 cot m K c E Pc H K ï�¡ ï�ª ï€­ ïƒ¦ ïƒ¶ïƒ¦ ïƒ¶ ï€½ ïƒ§ ïƒ·ïƒ§ ïƒ· ïƒ¨ ïƒ¸ ïƒ¨ ïƒ¸  (1)  2.2. Microstructure characteristics by EDS  The material properties of a solid depend on its own element  components and microstructure. ChG is an infrared transparent  glass formed by S, Se and Te from VI A in the periodic table,  and other metal elements such as Ge, Ga, As, Sb and so on.  Ge22Se58As20 is a far infrared ChG material with infrared  transmittance of 15 Î¼m. It is fabricated by melt quenching  method according to the volume fraction of each element of  22%, 58% and 20% respectively. Studies revealed that the  element composition and microstructure of optical glass were  closely related to its elastic-plastic deformation and brittle  fracture behavior during the processing [13]. The elemental  concentration was analyzed by a field-emission scanning  electron microscope (FESEM, S-4800, Hitachi, Japan), which  was equipped with energy dispersive spectrometer (EDS) at an  acceleration voltage of 5 kV. The EDS spectrum is shown in  Fig. 2. The concentrations of the elements in the sample are  22.18 at%, 57.66 at%, 20.16 at% separately, consistent with the  designed ratio well.   0 1 2 3 4 5 0 20 40 60 80 100 120 140 160 180 200 220 182.47 168.45 196.88 170.26 157.62 V ic ke rs  h ar dn es s ( H V ) Test location   Fig. 1.

The EDS spectrum display of ChG  According to the theory of irregular network structure  model of amorphous materials, the bridge oxygen bond is  stronger than that of the non-bridge oxygen bond. The oxygen  ions in silica glass are all bridge oxygen. Some bridge oxygen  bonds are cut off becoming non-bridge oxygen bonds, and the  strength and hardness decrease after adding metal elements.  Therefore, the hardness of silicate glass with metal ions is  usually lower [14-15]. The selenium in the ChG and the  oxygen in the silicate glass are both VI A elements, having  similar chemical properties. As illustrated in Fig. 3, it can be  speculated that the hardness decreased after the addition of  germanium due to the non-bridge Se.   Author name / Procedia CIRP 00 (2018) 000â€“000  3    Fig. 3. Schematic illustration of As-Se-Ge structure  3. Cutting experiment of ChG  3.1. Cutting transition analysis by orthogonal cutting  All experiments were conducted on an ultraprecision  machine center Nanoform X (produced by Precitech  Corporation, USA), which achieves a positioning resolution of  0.1 nm and a moving straightness of 0.1 Î¼m/50 mm. It has two  air bearing spindle, a maximum 10000 rpm turning spindle and  a maximum 40000 rpm milling spindle. A water-soluble mist  was used for cooling during all the cutting experiments, and it  also removed most of the chips off the machined surface before  ultrasonic cleaning.  There are reports suggesting a transition of cutting  mechanism in other materials [7-9]. Relatively lower hardness  indicates that the ChG probably has a greater critical cutting  thickness. In order to achieve the maximum depth of cut under  SPDT of ChG in ductile regime, orthogonal cutting experiment  is then conducted. As presented in Fig. 4, diamond tool was set  up on a Kistler 9256C dynamometer, using a 5080 amplifier  with a solution of 0.1mN. Sampling frequency was 1000Hz.  The workpiece with an outer diameter of 15 mm and an inner  diameter of 11 mm for free cutting was fixed by a fixture  mounted on the spindle. As shown in Fig. 5, a V-shaped  pointed diamond tool with an included angle of 90Â°, 0Â° rake,  12Â° clearance angle and a 100 nm edge radius was used. The  cutting speed was kept at 0.68 m/s (1000 rpm), and the depth  of cut (tc) varied from 20 nm to 10 Î¼m. The chips were  collected and observed using a 3D laser scanning microscope  (VK-X100, Keyence, Japan). The surface roughness was  characterized by a non-contact 3D Optical Profiler (Talysurf  CCI, Taylor Hobson, UK) after ultrasonic cleaning.       (a) (b)  Fig. 4.

SEM photograph of diamond tool: (a) 90Â° included angle and (b) 100 nm  edge radius  Fig. 6 shows the forces acting on the tool during a cutting  operation as a function of tc, the â€œthrust forceâ€� (Fy) acts in the  x direction and the â€œmain cutting forceâ€� (Fz) acts in the  orthogonal direction to x. It is evident that the forces in two  directions have the similar trend of change, and the forces have  two turning points, which correspond to ð�‘¡ð�‘¡ð�‘�ð�‘� equals to 100 nm  and 1.2 Î¼m respectively. As tc below 100 nm, forces decrease  with the increasing of tc, indicating a size effect described in  other work [16-17]. For tc between 100 nm to 1.2 Î¼m, the forces  increase proportionally, and then decrease sharply, which  suggests a brittle-ductile transition and the tc equals to 1.2 Î¼m  at the peak point. The forces changes unstably as tc is above 1.2  Î¼m, where brittle fracture occurs.   0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 0.00 0.05 0.10 0.15 0.20     C ut tin g  fo rc es  (N )  Fz main cutting force  Fy thrust force Depth of cut (Î¼m)  c t   Fig. 6. Values of cutting forces versus tuct in orthogonal cutting  Fig. 7 shows the surface roughness of Ge22Se58As20 in  orthogonal cutting. The change of the surface roughness shows  the same tendency with cutting force change. When the depth  of cut is 50 nm, the result is Ra 0.12 Î¼m. There were not  available chips to be collected at the same time, and as  presented in Fig. 8a, the machined surface appeared a  ploughing trace also indicating a size effect in nano-metric  cutting. Fig. 8b-c show the images of a typical chips formation  and machined surface. For tc between 100 nm to 1.2 Î¼m, the  surface roughness values are all below Ra 20 nm. And  especially when tc is between 200 nm to 800 nm, it is less than  Ra 10 nm, which is a necessary requirement for optical  specifications. The chips have a continuous long strip shape,  and the surface appears smooth like an optical surface  according with the characteristics of ductile machining. On the  contrary, it presents irregular crack fractures when tc equals 1.4  Î¼m, and there were many pits on the surface shown in Fig. 8d- 90Â° f  Fy  Fz   Longlong TANG et al. / Procedia CIRP 71 (2018) 293â€“298 295 2 Author name / Procedia CIRP 00 (2018) 000â€“000  section, and a critical depth parameter tc that dictated fracture  initiation. After decades of researches, there were new  continuous theories and discoveries about various brittle  materials.   Jia P [8] recognized that BK7 glass brittle-ductile transition  depth was 0.502 Î¼m by scratching test, and suggested that the  value of the critical depth of cut increased with the  concentration of boric acid solution. Yan J [9] showed that by  using slow tool servo method a form error of ~300 nm PV and  surface roughness of ~6 nm Sa spherical microlens array were  successfully fabricated. Fang [10] provided an approach to  machining smooth freeform surfaces with rectangular aperture  via ultraprecision turning. Surface topographic details showed  that form error of a micron level and surface roughness of 5.41  nm had been achieved. Unlike brittle hard materials, the ChG  has a much lower hardness, and the defects must be controlled  by cutting below the critical cutting depth to avoid brittle  fracture, and at the same time, the material should be removed  above the minimum cutting thickness for chip formation at the  region of ploughing. In order to achieve high precision optical  surface at the high efficiency by SPDT, it is necessary to  further study this kind of soft brittle material.  In this paper, a kind of far infrared glass Ge22Se58As20  (IRG202) is studied. The machining mechanics of  Ge22Se58As20 is principally investigated, and then the brittle- ductile transition phenomenon and the ploughing phenomenon  are observed successively during cutting ChG. The critical  cutting thickness and the minimum cutting thickness are tested  through orthogonal cutting. Accordingly, the uncut chip  thickness (tuct) to achieve ductile regime machining is acquired.  Finally, an optical surface of aspheric lens is achieved by face  turning at a high material removal rate.  2. Material description and testing  2.1. Vickers hardness test  As presented in Eq. (1), Lambropoulos [11] obtained the  formula of the depth of central crack c according to the theory  of the indentation fracture mechanics and the definition of the  fracture toughness of the material, where H is hardness that  affects the critical condition in ultraprecision machining brittle  materials. First, the value of hardness was measured by a  Vickers hardness tester (AHVD-1000, SIOOM, China). The  sample was polished and ultrasonically cleaned to remove the  impurities on the surface. Then, a load of 0.245 N was applied  to the sample and kept for 20 s. The test repeated at 5 different  locations of the sample randomly, and the values were shown  in Fig. 1. The average value is 175.14 HV which is much lower  than that of silica glass [12].   ï€¨ ï€© 2/3(1 )2/3 4/92/3 cot m K c E Pc H K ï�¡ ï�ª ï€­ ïƒ¦ ïƒ¶ïƒ¦ ïƒ¶ ï€½ ïƒ§ ïƒ·ïƒ§ ïƒ· ïƒ¨ ïƒ¸ ïƒ¨ ïƒ¸  (1)  2.2. Microstructure characteristics by EDS  The material properties of a solid depend on its own element  components and microstructure. ChG is an infrared transparent  glass formed by S, Se and Te from VI A in the periodic table,  and other metal elements such as Ge, Ga, As, Sb and so on.  Ge22Se58As20 is a far infrared ChG material with infrared  transmittance of 15 Î¼m. It is fabricated by melt quenching  method according to the volume fraction of each element of  22%, 58% and 20% respectively. Studies revealed that the  element composition and microstructure of optical glass were  closely related to its elastic-plastic deformation and brittle  fracture behavior during the processing [13]. The elemental  concentration was analyzed by a field-emission scanning  electron microscope (FESEM, S-4800, Hitachi, Japan), which  was equipped with energy dispersive spectrometer (EDS) at an  acceleration voltage of 5 kV. The EDS spectrum is shown in  Fig. 2. The concentrations of the elements in the sample are  22.18 at%, 57.66 at%, 20.16 at% separately, consistent with the  designed ratio well.   0 1 2 3 4 5 0 20 40 60 80 100 120 140 160 180 200 220 182.47 168.45 196.88 170.26 157.62 V ic ke rs  h ar dn es s ( H V ) Test location   Fig. 1.

The EDS spectrum display of ChG  According to the theory of irregular network structure  model of amorphous materials, the bridge oxygen bond is  stronger than that of the non-bridge oxygen bond. The oxygen  ions in silica glass are all bridge oxygen. Some bridge oxygen  bonds are cut off becoming non-bridge oxygen bonds, and the  strength and hardness decrease after adding metal elements.  Therefore, the hardness of silicate glass with metal ions is  usually lower [14-15]. The selenium in the ChG and the  oxygen in the silicate glass are both VI A elements, having  similar chemical properties. As illustrated in Fig. 3, it can be  speculated that the hardness decreased after the addition of  germanium due to the non-bridge Se.   Author name / Procedia CIRP 00 (2018) 000â€“000  3    Fig. 3. Schematic illustration of As-Se-Ge structure  3. Cutting experiment of ChG  3.1. Cutting transition analysis by orthogonal cutting  All experiments were conducted on an ultraprecision  machine center Nanoform X (produced by Precitech  Corporation, USA), which achieves a positioning resolution of  0.1 nm and a moving straightness of 0.1 Î¼m/50 mm. It has two  air bearing spindle, a maximum 10000 rpm turning spindle and  a maximum 40000 rpm milling spindle. A water-soluble mist  was used for cooling during all the cutting experiments, and it  also removed most of the chips off the machined surface before  ultrasonic cleaning.  There are reports suggesting a transition of cutting  mechanism in other materials [7-9]. Relatively lower hardness  indicates that the ChG probably has a greater critical cutting  thickness. In order to achieve the maximum depth of cut under  SPDT of ChG in ductile regime, orthogonal cutting experiment  is then conducted. As presented in Fig. 4, diamond tool was set  up on a Kistler 9256C dynamometer, using a 5080 amplifier  with a solution of 0.1mN. Sampling frequency was 1000Hz.  The workpiece with an outer diameter of 15 mm and an inner  diameter of 11 mm for free cutting was fixed by a fixture  mounted on the spindle. As shown in Fig. 5, a V-shaped  pointed diamond tool with an included angle of 90Â°, 0Â° rake,  12Â° clearance angle and a 100 nm edge radius was used. The  cutting speed was kept at 0.68 m/s (1000 rpm), and the depth  of cut (tc) varied from 20 nm to 10 Î¼m. The chips were  collected and observed using a 3D laser scanning microscope  (VK-X100, Keyence, Japan). The surface roughness was  characterized by a non-contact 3D Optical Profiler (Talysurf  CCI, Taylor Hobson, UK) after ultrasonic cleaning.       (a) (b)  Fig. 4.

It is evident that the forces in two  directions have the similar trend of change, and the forces have  two turning points, which correspond to ð�‘¡ð�‘¡ð�‘�ð�‘� equals to 100 nm  and 1.2 Î¼m respectively. As tc below 100 nm, forces decrease  with the increasing of tc, indicating a size effect described in  other work [16-17]. For tc between 100 nm to 1.2 Î¼m, the forces  increase proportionally, and then decrease sharply, which  suggests a brittle-ductile transition and the tc equals to 1.2 Î¼m  at the peak point. The forces changes unstably as tc is above 1.2  Î¼m, where brittle fracture occurs.   0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 0.00 0.05 0.10 0.15 0.20     C ut tin g  fo rc es  (N )  Fz main cutting force  Fy thrust force Depth of cut (Î¼m)  c t   Fig. 6. Values of cutting forces versus tuct in orthogonal cutting  Fig. 7 shows the surface roughness of Ge22Se58As20 in  orthogonal cutting. The change of the surface roughness shows  the same tendency with cutting force change. When the depth  of cut is 50 nm, the result is Ra 0.12 Î¼m. There were not  available chips to be collected at the same time, and as  presented in Fig. 8a, the machined surface appeared a  ploughing trace also indicating a size effect in nano-metric  cutting. Fig. 8b-c show the images of a typical chips formation  and machined surface. For tc between 100 nm to 1.2 Î¼m, the  surface roughness values are all below Ra 20 nm. And  especially when tc is between 200 nm to 800 nm, it is less than  Ra 10 nm, which is a necessary requirement for optical  specifications. The chips have a continuous long strip shape,  and the surface appears smooth like an optical surface  according with the characteristics of ductile machining. On the  contrary, it presents irregular crack fractures when tc equals 1.4  Î¼m, and there were many pits on the surface shown in Fig. 8d- 90Â° f  Fy  Fz  296 Longlong TANG et al. / Procedia CIRP 71 (2018) 293â€“298 4 Author name / Procedia CIRP 00 (2018) 000â€“000  e, revealing that a brittle removal mechanism dominates  apparently.

Critical cutting thickness in turning  As illustrated in Fig. 9, during the process of turning  aspheric lens, the uncut chip thickness is the actual depth of cut,  which is determined by feed and other factors. Thus face  turning was carried out. As shown in Fig. 10, the workpiece  with a diameter of 15 mm was fixed like before. A diamond  tool having a nose radius of 0.5 mm, a 60Â° included angle, a 0Â°  rake angle and a 12Â°clearance angle was used. The maximum  uncut chip thickness tuct is given as follows:  ï€¨ ï€©ï€¨ ï€© ï€¨ ï€©ï€¨ ï€© ï€¨ ï€©2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 22 Â´ Â´ Â´              uct c r c O A OA OE DE O O O CAB R R R f Rt t t ï€½ ï€­ ï€­ ï€­ ï€­ ï€«ï€½ ï€½ ï€­ ï€­ ï€­ ï€­ ï€« ï€­   (2)  where R is tool radius; tc, depth of cut; fr, feed per revolution.  The tc was kept constant at 30 Î¼m in this experiment, and fr was  varied from 1 mm/r to 12 mm/r, thus the tuct was 0.34 Î¼m to  3.96 Î¼m correspondingly.     Fig. 9. Illustration of tuct under each fr     (a) (b)  Fig. 10. Face turning (a) experiment setup and (b) illustration of processing  Fig. 11 shows the forces as a function of fr, the â€œthrust forceâ€�  (Fx) acts in the x direction, the â€œtangential cutting forceâ€� (Fy)  acts in the y direction and the â€œmain cutting forceâ€� (Fz) acts in  the orthogonal direction to x and y planes. The variation  tendency of forces is the same as in orthogonal cutting. For fr  between 0.4 mm/r to 4 mm/r, the forces go up in direct  proportion, and a sharp decrease occurs at fr equals to 4 mm/r  corresponding to tuct equals to 1.35 Î¼m, which is close to 1.2  Î¼m in orthogonal cutting, also indicating a brittle-ductile  transition. Besides, the dominance of trust force (Fx) over main  cutting force (Fz) in micro nano-metric cutting while in macro  cutting is the opposite [18], which is a field yet to be studied.  The material removal rate (MMR) in face turning can be  explicitly expressed as:   c rQ f Rtï�°ï€½ ï‚´ ï‚´  (3)  where Q is MMR; tc, depth of cut; R, workpiece radius.  Therefore the MMR of aspherical lens in SPDT is determined  fr  Author name / Procedia CIRP 00 (2018) 000â€“000  5  by both tc and fr. To achieve ductile regime cutting, the tuct must  be blow 1.2 Î¼m. According to Eq. (2), the functional  relationship is shown in Fig. 12. Theoretically, the greater the  tc, the larger the tcÂ·fr, and the lager the MMR it is. Thus we  should choose the diamond tool with a large nose radius and  included angle. However, a large radius may lead to  interference and serious tool wear due to the higher material  removal volume in the process of aspheric lens turning, which  should be considered in a comprehensive practical way.    0 2 4 6 8 10 0.00 0.02 0.04 0.06 0.08 0.10 0.12 Fo rc eï¼ˆ N ï¼‰ fr  Fx thrust force   Fy tagential cutting force   Fz main cutting force Ra 86 nmRa 10 nm 20 um 20 um Feed rate       (mm/r) C ut tin g  fo rc es  (N )   Fig. 11.

Fabrication of aspherical lens by SPDT  Based on the above results, a ChG aspheric convex lens with  a diameter of 15 mm was then successfully fabricated by  ultraprecision SPDT shown in Fig. 13. It was interpolated by x  and z axis linkage, and the aspheric equation is given as follows:  2 4 6 8 10 12 2 ( )1 1 1 X RZ AX BX CX DX EX X Rk ï€½ ï€« ï€« ï€« ï€« ï€« ï€« ï€­ ïƒ—ï€«   (4)  where Z is sag; X, semi-aperture; R, radius of curvature; k,  conic constant. The parameters of the equation are summarized  in Table 1, and turning parameters are shown in Table 2.   The machined surface of the aspheric lens was measured in  the range of 2 mm in diameter, it can be clearly seen that the  machined and the theoretical shape match very well shown in  Fig. 14a. As presented in Fig.14b, the deviations were filtered  with a cut-off frequency of 0.267 Hz. Thus a surface roughness  of Ra 6.47 nm and a form error of PV 120.82 nm are obtained,  which meets the design requirement of ChG aspheric lens.  Table 1. Parameters of aspheric equation.

The hardness and element composition of Ge22Se58As20 are  tested, and two mechanic cutting transitions in SPDT of ChG  Ge22Se58As20 are studied. The maximum depth of cut to  achieve ductile regime machining is obtained 1.2 Î¼m, and the  uncut chip thickness should be between 100 nm to 1.2 Î¼m for  chip formation.

However, as a soft brittle material, the surface is easily cracked during cutting. With the increasing demand for imaging quality, the surface integrity of chalcogenide glasses becomes increasingly important. This paper proposes a method to achieve high-precision and high-efficiency aspheric lens by SPDT. First, to study the material properties, the Vickers hardness of Ge<ce:inf loc="post">22</ce:inf>Se<ce:inf loc="post">58</ce:inf>As<ce:inf loc="post">20</ce:inf> is tested, and the element components and microstructure are analysed by EDS. Second, through orthogonal cutting, the critical cutting thickness of the brittle-ductile transition is tested to be 1.2 μm and the minimum depth of cut for chip formation of 100 nm is identified. The material removal rate under ductile machining in face turning was calculated. Finally, by optimizing the machining condition, an aspheric lens with surface roughness of Ra 6.47 nm and form error of PV 120.82 nm was successfully fabricated.</ce:simple-para>
